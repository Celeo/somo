# üåè ‚¨Ö somo ‚¨Ö :man_technologist: 
### A prettier alternative to netstat or ss for socket monitoring.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features:
### 1. Pretty and easily readable table:
![somo-example](./images/somo-example.png)

### 2. Filtering:
You can filter by **remote port**, **local port**, **IP**, **protocol**, **client program**, **PID** and **connection status**.
Check the flag descriptions below.

### 3. Process killing:
With the ``-k`` flag you can choose to kill a process after inspecting the connections using an interactive selection option.

### 4. Checking for malicious IPs using [AbuseIPDB.com](https://www.abuseipdb.com/):
To automatically check if any of the remote IPs you are connected to are malicious you can specify an API key for the AbuseIPDB API as an environment variable:
```bash
export ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY={your-api-key} # not persistent
```
Adding the ``-c`` flag will then check for malicious IPs and notify you in the table:

## üö© Flags:
| flag | description | value |
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- |
| ```--proto``` | filter by either TCP or UDP  | ``tcp`` or ``udp`` | 
| ```--ip``` | filter by a remote IP | the IP address e.g ``0.0.0.0`` |
| ```--port, -p``` | filter by a remote port | the port number, e.g ``443`` |
| ```--local-port``` | filter by a local port | the port number, e.g ``5433`` |
| ```--program``` | filter by a client program | the program name e.g ``chrome`` |
| ```--pid, -p``` | filter by a PID | the PID number, e.g ``10000`` |
| ```--open, -o``` | filter by open connections | - |
| ```--exclude-ipv6, -e``` | don't list IPv6 connections | - |
| ```--kill, -k``` | interactive process killing | - |
| ```--check, -c``` | check remote IPs using AbuseIPDB (make sure the environment variable ``ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY`` is set) | - |

#### Todos:
- [ ] find a way to make the API key persistent (env. variable only stays with current shell session)
- [ ] implement tests
- [ ] make it a crate
