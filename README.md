#### 1. Pretty and easy readable table:
All connections are displayed in a pretty and easily readable table:
![example](./images/somo-example.png)
#### 2. Filtering:
You can filter by **remote-port**, **IP**, **protocol**, **client program**, **PID** and **connection status**.
Check the flag descriptions below.

#### 3. Process killing:
After inspecting your connections you can decide to kill a process using an interactive selection option.

#### 4. Checking for malicious IPs using [AbuseIPDB.com](https://www.abuseipdb.com/):
To automatically check if any of the remote IPs you are connected to are malicious you can specify an API key for the AbuseIPDB API as an environment variable:
```bash
export ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY={your-api-key}
```
Adding the ``-k`` flag will then check for malicious IPs and notify you in the table:
